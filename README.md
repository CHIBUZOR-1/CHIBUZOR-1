# 👋 Hi, I'm Chibuzor Henry Amaechi

💻 **Fullstack Developer | PWA & DevOps Enthusiast | Software Testing Advocate**

I build scalable fullstack applications with a focus on performance, offline-first experiences, and modern DevOps practices. From real-time chat apps to PWAs with service workers, authentication systems with automated tests, to CI/CD pipelines with Docker and Kubernetes — I craft apps that are production-ready from day one.
